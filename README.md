# 🫑 StockPoint 🧂
StockPoint is an all-in-one pantry and refrigerator management application that helps users keep track of their food inventory. It combines three key features: a tracker to monitor available ingredients, a chef that suggests recipes based on what’s in stock, and an expiration date tracker that alerts users about soon-to-expire items. With StockPoint, users can reduce food waste, plan meals more efficiently, and spend less time thinking about what recipe they could make with their available resources they have.
